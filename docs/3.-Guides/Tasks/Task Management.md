 # Task Managment
The task managment domain has been broken into 4 contexts. Each context represents the frame of mind that a user consuming the API results is in. 
- **Fufillment Agent**: The user is an employee of the organization that is responcible for completing the task.
- Proposed: **Vendor Agent**: The user is an employee of a different organization that the completion of the task has been outsourced to.
- **Customer**: The user purchased a service or product and the task is being used to track the status of delivery. 
- **Administrator**: The caller of the API has full administrative access to the update tasks owned by the organization. 

There are several types of tasks each with a unique set of properties and validation needs. Only `Generic`, `Project` and `GenericSubtasks` can be created by API. The other task types are generated by the platform. General fields on them may be updated. 


## Data Representations
- `adminTasks`: Provides access to all fields on a task. It is intended for integrations that syncronize data between systems or perform other administrative actions as it allows some normally read only fields to be updated. 
- `customerProjects`: Provides a view of `Project` type tasks that is limited to data that can be displayed to users in the customer context.
- `customerSubtasks`: Provides a view of subtasks within a project. Customers can respond to feedback requests on specfic subtasks. They may be fetched in a singed request along with the `customerProjects`.
- `fufillmentTasks`: Provides a full view of all fields on a task. It is broken down into 3 sub representations.

{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://demo.apigateway.co/tasks/fulfillmentTasks",
  "query": {
    "filter[type]": "meeting,generic",
    "filter[duedate][<]": "20201001",
    "filter[duedate][>=]": "20201031"
  }

Task manager admins can undelete a task by removing the deleted date
They can also view the deleted data and set a flag on the search to include deleted


Models
- Admin Task
  - Contains all possible fields
- Fufillment Project
  - Contains project specific fields & list of subtasks
- 



Only "Custom", "Projects" and "CustomSubtask" task types can be created via API. The other task types are created by the platform and contain additional meta data used to change the way they are displayed.


Questions:
- Why can an SSC user not view their tasks in Task Manager
- Are SSC tasks a different "type" or "category"
- Should we allow extra data to be stored on custom tasks and projects (using the "data" field)
- Should attachments have a public/private visability status, Are all attachments on a public task public?
- Why do attachments have an uploading persona?
