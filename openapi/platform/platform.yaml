        A Sales Contact is a person who works for the business that your sales team may send communications to regarding the business.

        Note: Currently when creating a contact you must specify exactly 1 businessLocations id for it to be linked to. We intend to expand this limit.

        A partner is an organization that has a store filled with products that other organizations can purchase.


        Partners may fill one or more of the following roles:
        - **Business Partner**: Have a direct billing relationship with SMBs
        - **Vendor**: Integrate goods into the Vendasta platform to be sold by Business Partners to SMBs
        - **Service Provider**: Integrate services into the Vendasta platform that they will fulfill for SMBs

        Note: Small/Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs) are represented by their primary Business Location record. They may only buy products through their Business Partner.

        Purchases generated by the platform to record the wholesale fees that are charged to a partner for products they sell to their customers. One time fees and each renewal will appear as seperate line items broken out per customer.


        All amounts will be specified in the minor unit of the purchase's currency. For example in the case of USD that would be cents. For more info on converting between minor and major units see [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Minor_units_of_currency).
