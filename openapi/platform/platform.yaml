        Invoices generated by the platform to record the wholesale fees that are charged to a partner for products they sell to their customers. One time fees and each renewal will appear as seperate line items broken out per customer. 


        All amounts will be specified in the minor unit of the invoice's currency. For example in the case of USD that would be cents. For more info on converting between minor and major units see [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Minor_units_of_currency).
